This is a repository for the whole tracking pipeline. A script is used to execute the different steps for tracking:

1. autocontext produces body part probability maps
2. deformable part model takes body part probability maps and generates scoremap  
3. graphical model takes detection hypothesis and generate tracks

format for InputData: for more information see InputFormat.txt files in directory InputData
1. autocontext: 
    4 images with labeled groundtruth 
      
2. dpm:
3.
